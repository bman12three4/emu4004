instructions to implement:
	WMP,
	WRR,
	RDR,

need to check on SUB, well really you should check all of them,
you might even consider writing tests for them??

The 4004 supports 12 byte addresses but that is not implemented  yet,
only the 256x4 is available currently.

Still need to do tests for ram and I/O
